The front-end typically uses technologies like React to create a user interface, while the back-end might use Python or Java to handle data processing and server-side logic.  Databases (like SQL or NoSQL) store and manage the application's data, with the back-end acting as an intermediary between the front-end and the database.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Explain your experience with Python, Java, and React.  Give examples of projects where you used these technologies.\",\n      \"answer\": \"While I have 0 years of professional experience, I've worked on personal projects using Python for scripting and data analysis, Java for building small applications, and React for creating interactive user interfaces.  For example, I built a simple to-do list app using React, a basic web scraper in Python, and a small console-based game in Java.  These projects helped me understand the fundamentals of each technology.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"How would you approach debugging a complex issue spanning both the front-end and back-end of an application?\",\n      \"answer\": \"I would start by systematically isolating the problem.  I'd use browser developer tools to inspect the front-end for errors in the console or network requests.  Then, I'd examine server-side logs and use debugging tools in my chosen back-end language (Python or Java) to trace the flow of data and identify the source of the error.  If necessary, I'd use techniques like print statements or logging to track variables and identify the point of failure.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Describe your understanding of RESTful APIs and how they are used in web applications.\",\n      \"answer\": \"RESTful APIs are a standard way for different parts of an application to communicate.  They use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform actions on resources.  For example, a GET request might retrieve data, while a POST request might create new data.  RESTful APIs are crucial for connecting the front-end and back-end, allowing the front-end to request data and the back-end to respond with the appropriate information.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"How familiar are you with version control systems like Git?\",\n      \"answer\": \"I have a basic understanding of Git and have used it for personal projects. I'm familiar with common commands like `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git pull`. I understand the importance of branching and merging for collaborative development.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Design a simple system for a to-do list application.  Consider the database, API endpoints, and front-end components.\",\n      \"answer\": \"The database would store tasks with fields like ID, description, due date, and completion status.  The API would have endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.  The front-end would display a list of tasks, allowing users to add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks.  The front-end would communicate with the back-end API to perform these actions.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Tell me about a time you faced a challenging technical problem and how you overcame it.\",\n      \"answer\": \"In a personal project, I encountered an issue with asynchronous JavaScript code in React.  I used debugging tools to identify the problem, researched solutions online, and experimented with different approaches until I found a solution that worked.  This experience taught me the importance of patience and persistence in problem-solving.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"How do you stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in full-stack development?\",\n      \"answer\": \"I regularly read technical blogs, follow industry influencers on social media, and participate in online communities.  I also explore new technologies through personal projects and online courses.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Describe your experience working in a team environment.\",\n      \"answer\": \"While I haven't worked in a professional team setting, I've collaborated on group projects in school, where I learned the importance of communication, collaboration, and respecting different perspectives.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What are your salary expectations for this role?\",\n      \"answer\": \"I am open to discussing salary based on the specifics of the role and company compensation structure.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What are your strengths and weaknesses as a developer?\",\n      \"answer\": \"My strengths include a strong work ethic, a willingness to learn, and a passion for problem-solving.  A weakness is my lack of professional experience, but I am eager to learn and contribute to a team.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
