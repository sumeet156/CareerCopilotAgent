# Hackathon Submission Notes

## Last-minute Changes

For the hackathon submission, the following adjustments were made:

1. **Job Tracker Tab Disabled**:

   - The Job Application Tracker feature was temporarily disabled due to API limitations with Google Sheets.
   - The code remains in place for future development but is commented out in the UI.

2. **Demo Mode Enhancement**:

   - Added a dedicated demo mode (--demo flag) that demonstrates the core Gmail scanning functionality without requiring Google Sheets integration.
   - This allows judges to see the core AI capabilities without needing complex API setup.

3. **Interview Prep Improvement**:

   - Fixed JSON parsing issues in the Interview Prep feature to ensure reliable operation.
   - Added better error handling for JSON responses from the LLM.

4. **Testing Scripts**:
   - Added test utilities to help verify each feature works independently.
   - The test_features.bat script provides an easy way to verify core functionality.

## Future Development Path

After the hackathon, the following areas can be further developed:

1. **Complete Google Sheets Integration**:

   - Re-enable the Job Tracker tab once full API permissions are established.
   - Implement direct Sheets API access as a fallback to the Portia tools.

2. **Advanced Resume Analysis**:

   - Enhance the resume parser with detailed keyword matching.
   - Add more specific suggestions for improvement.

3. **Improved Email Classification**:
   - Expand the patterns recognized in job-related emails.
   - Add priority scoring for job opportunities.

The current submission demonstrates the core AI capabilities while acknowledging the practical limitations of API integrations in a hackathon environment.
